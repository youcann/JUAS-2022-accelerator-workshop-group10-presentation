  abstract  = {Rivaroxaban{,} as a direct oral anticoagulant{,} has been widely used in the treatment and prevention of thrombosis disease (TD). However{,} even if the same dose of rivaroxaban is taken{,} different pathophysiological characteristics of TD patients determine the differences in plasma concentrations between individuals{,} leading to the difficulties of dosage selection and plasma concentration control. Conventional rivaroxaban detection methods{,} including prothrombin time method{,} anti-Xa assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS){,} are not widely used in clinical practice due to the limitations of accuracy{,} speed and cost. Here{,} we present a simple quantitative detection method for rivaroxaban by terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Combining density functional theory (DFT) method and THz spectroscopy{,} the THz absorption peaks of rivaroxaban and the corresponding low-frequency vibrational modes are studied theoretically and experimentally. We find linear relationships between the amplitudes of these characteristic peaks and the concentrations of rivaroxaban. Based on these linear functions{,} we can analyse the rivaroxaban concentration with a detection time of 1 minute per test and the lowest detection limit of 2 μmol mL−1. As compared to Raman spectroscopy method (its detection limit is about 80 μmol mL−1){,} our method has more potential and is practical for the clinical quantitative detection of rivaroxaban as well as other direct oral anticoagulants.},
